## 👹 Krampus — Roaming MVP Boss

The terrible **Krampus** stalks the lands of Rune Midgard, punishing the naughty and stealing presents! This horned demon MVP spawns every **3 hours** at random locations.

### 📊 Boss Stats

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **MVP** | Krampus |
| **Spawn Frequency** | Every 3 hours |
| **Race** | Demon |
| **Property** | Dark |

### 🏆 MVP Rewards (granted to player that deals killer blow)

| ![Event Ticket](../images/icons/7941.gif) Event Ticket | 50 + (1-50 bonus) | Base reward plus random bonus |
| ![Yggdrasil Berry](../images/icons/607.gif) Yggdrasil Berry | 2 | Guaranteed |

### 📍 How the Boss Spawning Works

Krampus can appear in one of **five festive locations**:

- **prt_fild08** — Southern fields of Prontera
- **pay_fild01** — Forest south of Payon
- **gef_fild07** — Rolling hills west of Geffen
- **gef_fild04** — Bridge north of Geffen
- **prt_fild06** — Eastern grasslands of Prontera

### 🔮 Riddle Hint System

Krampus doesn't reveal his location immediately! Players must decipher cryptic riddles:

!!! info "Riddle Timeline"
    - **Spawn**: First riddle hint is broadcast immediately
    - **After 2 minutes**: Second riddle hint appears
    - **After 4 minutes**: Final riddle hint

!!! example "Example Riddle Hints"
    - *"Where southern fields of Prontera sprawl, and adventurers gather at nature's call"*
    - *"Where forest paths wind south and deep, in Payon's shadow secrets keep"*
    - *"Where Geffen's bridge does northward span, crossing waters since time began"*

### 🌙 Atmospheric Effects

When Krampus spawns:

- The sky turns to **perpetual night**
- **No EXP penalty** on the boss map (safe to fight!)
- **Daylight returns** when the beast is defeated

### 🔥 The Yule Hearth

After Krampus is defeated, the **Yule Hearth's power is restored**! Visit **Santa's Elf** in **Prontera (147,196)** to warm yourself by the magical fire. This applies for the whole server.

#### Yule Hearth Buff Benefits

Warming yourself by the hearth grants **powerful 20-minute buffs**:

| Buff | Effect | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| **![Increase AGI](../images/skills/al_incagi.gif) Increase AGI Level 10** | +12 AGI and Movement Speed | 20 minutes |
| **![Blessing](../images/skills/al_blessing.gif) Blessing Level 10** | +10 STR, DEX & INT | 20 minutes |
| **![Angelus](../images/skills/al_angelus.gif) Angelus Level 10** | Soft Defense (from VIT) +50% | 20 minutes |

!!! warning "Yule Hearth Usage Limits"
    - You can only warm yourself **once per Krampus defeat**
    - The hearth remains dormant until the next Krampus is slain
