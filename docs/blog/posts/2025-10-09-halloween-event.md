![Ancient Horns](../images/halloween-event/AncientHorns.png)


### 📍 How the Boss Spawning Works

The Aberration can appear in one of **five haunted locations**:

- **prt_fild08** — Southern fields of Prontera
- **prt_fild06** — Eastern grasslands of Prontera
- **pay_fild01** — Southern fields of Payon
- **gef_fild07** — Rolling hills west of Geffen
- **gef_fild04** — Bridge north of Geffen

### 🔮 Riddle Hint System

The Aberration doesn't reveal its location immediately! Players must decipher cryptic riddles:

!!! info "Riddle Timeline"
    - **Spawn**: First riddle hint is broadcast immediately
    - **After 2 minutes**: Second riddle hint appears
    - **After 4 minutes**: Final location hint reveals the exact area

!!! example "Example Riddle Hints"
    - *"Where shadows writhe in Prontera's domain, and southern winds whisper Aberration's name"*
    - *"Where phantom bowstrings draw and sigh, beneath a perpetually moonless sky"*
    - *"Where murky waters flow and a bridge does span, a crossing place for ghouls and man"*

### 🌙 Atmospheric Effects

When the Aberration spawns:

- The sky turns to **perpetual night**
- **No EXP penalty** on the boss map (safe to fight!)
- **Daylight returns** when the beast is defeated

### 🍺 The Great Cauldron

After the Aberration is defeated, the **Great Cauldron's power is restored**! Visit the **Witch's Apprentice** in **Prontera (146,197)** to drink the magical brew. This applies for the whole server.

![Witch'sApprentice](../images/halloween-event/Witch'sApprentice.png)


#### Cauldron Buff Benefits

Drinking from the cauldron grants **powerful 20-minute buffs**:

| Buff | Effect | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| **![Increase AGI](../images/skills/al_incagi.gif) Increase AGI Level 10** | +12 AGI and Movement Speed | 20 minutes |
| **![Blessing](../images/skills/al_blessing.gif) Blessing Level 10** | +10 STR, DEX & INT | 20 minutes |
| **![Angelus](../images/skills/al_angelus.gif) Angelus Level 10** | Soft Defense (from VIT) +50% | 20 minutes |

!!! warning "Cauldron Usage Limits"
    - You can only drink **once per Aberration defeat**
    - The cauldron remains dormant until the next Aberration is slain

#### 💰 Reset Brew Timer

You can purchase another usage of the Witch's Brew for **30 Halloween Tickets**!

!!! note "Brew Usage Rules"
    - You get **one free usage per character** each time the Aberration is defeated.
    - You can only have **one active buff at a time** (buffs don't stack)
    - Once you've used your free drink, you must wait for the next Aberration kill **OR** pay 30 Halloween Tickets to drink again immediately
