## The Novice Life: Levels 1-10 🔰

As a fresh-faced Novice, your first goal is to reach Job Level 10. You'll start in the Novice Grounds: make sure to go talk to the NPCs and do as they tell you to get free Level Ups! The fastest way to get to Job Level 10 is to hunt **Spores** on the Novice Training Grounds. Don't hesitate to use the Novice Potions you got. Easy peasy! 😉
When you have reached Job 10, do take the course at the end of the Training Grounds to get more free stuff. ✨

## 🌱 Early Game Adventures (Approx. Lv. 10-40) 🌱

> ### 🍄 **Payon Field 01 or 08** 🍄
> *A classic starting map, perfect for every class.*

> * **Monsters:** Spores
> * **Strategy:** Honestly? Just blast 'em! 💥 They go down easy.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * **Strawberries:** Great for SP recovery! 🍓 A lot of players buy these in the market, so you can make some early zeny.

> ### **Morroc Field 18** 
> *Another easy leveling spot to start early on.*

> * **Monsters:** Mukas
> * **Strategy:** Avoid the Hunter fly on the map!
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * **Empty Bottles:** Sell them to other players. They are in high demand.
>     * **Green Herbs:** Same as the Bottles, fill your pockets!
>     * **Green Live:** Used for getting the Earth Element to attacks via seperate means.
>     * **Clip[1]:** Only if you are confident (and lucky) in killing the Dragon Fly. This is *the* slotted accessory to have when leveling up!

> ### **Prontera Field 02** 
> *Want free levels as a ranged? Go here.*

> * **Monsters:** Mandragoras
> * **Strategy:** 🎯 They are stationary, so you can safely kill them from a distance.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * **Stems:** Can be sold to other players for brewing.
>     * ✨ **Mandragora Card:** More damage to Wind Property Enemies. High demand for killing Hill Winds.

> ### 🐺 **Payon Field 02** 🐺
> *Wolves can be a challenge if you're not well-equipped, especially due to their aggressive pack mentality!*

> * **Monsters:** Wolves
> * **Strategy:** 🎯 You'll have to play crowd control here. **Do not** mob a lot of wolves at once, as they hit hard!
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * **Strawberries:** More SP recovery goodness (or Zeny)! 🍓
>     * ✨ **Wolf Card:** ATK + 15 and Critical Rate + 1. An excellent early card!
>     * **Mantle[1]:** You can keep it and even try to enchant it and then put a Card in later or sell to other players.

## 🌿 Mid Game Mayhem (Approx. Lv. 40-70) 🌿

> ### 💀 **Payon Dungeon (Floors 2-4)** 💀
> *One of the early dungeons with great Drops.*

> * **Monsters:**
>     * **Floor 2:** Soldier Skeleton, Archer Skeleton, Eggyra, Drainliar
>     * **Floor 3:** Munak, Bongun, Soldier Skeleton, Archer Skeleton
>     * **Floor 4:** Munak, Bongun, Sohee
> * **Strategy:** 🏹 Archers should use Silver Arrows. 🙏 Acolytes can use `Heal` to kill Undead monsters (if SP allows it). Melee classes should bring plenty of potions! 🧙 Casters will truly shine on the higher floors, where they are not in danger of getting interrupted from the Archers.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * ✨ **Eggyra Card:** +15% SP recovery. Very high chance you either want this or Sohee Card.
>     * ✨ **Sohee Card:** +15% max SP and +3% SP recovery. Very high chance you either want this or Eggyra Card.
>     * ✨ **Shoes[1]:** Found one of those Cards? Put them in here. How convenient!
>     * **Archer Skeleton Card:** +10% damage on ranged attacks!
>     * ✨ **Apple of Archer:** +3 Dex. Sweet! 🍏

> ### 🐗 **Orc Village** 🐗
> *A fantastic spot for physical classes to gain experience and zeny.*

> * **Location:** Geffen Field 10 (Use Kafra Teleport from Geffen or Prontera)
> * **Monsters:** Orc Baby, Orc Warrior, Orc Lady
> * **Strategy:** These guys hit hard but give amazing experience. 🔥 They are weak to **Fire** property attacks!
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * ⭐ **Cyfar:** raw cash to fill your pocket!
>     * ⭐ **Orc Warrior Card:** Reduces damage from Brute monsters by 30%.
>     * ⭐ **Orc Lady Card:** 30% more damage to Orcs. Perfect, if you want to stay here or go on with High Orcs later.
>     * ⭐ **Orc Baby Card:** +10% resistance to Neutral attacks & Flee Rate + 10, if you manage to upgrade the garment.
>     * ⭐ **Earring:** INT +2 accessory. A great find!
> * **Boss Alert!** 🚨 **Orc Lord** and **Orc Hero** sometimes wander these maps. If you see one, teleport away immediately! 🏃💨


> ### 🌷 **Geographers & Mi Gaos** 🌷
> *These stationary and slow monsters are a caster's and archer's dream come true.*

> * **Locations:**
>     * **Geographers:** Einbroch Field 3 and 4
>     * **Mi Gaos:** Louyang Field (Take a boat from Alberta. The fee is 10k Zeny. Don't forget to save in Louyang Town!)
> * **Strategy:** 🎯 They can't move (Geos) or are really slow (Mi Gao), so attack from a safe distance. Both are super weak to **Fire**! 🔥 You can party up at Mi Gaos, one of you hits it from a distance, then others can safely melee them! 🗡️
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * 💎 **Valuable materials:** Gold and Great Nature from Mi Gaos.
>     * 💎 **Mantis Card:** You'll kill a lot of Mantis at Louyang, may luck be with you.

> ### 🐍 **Side Winders** 🐍
> *The best place for a party to get some seriously fast levels.*

> * **Location:** Veins Field 04
> * **Strategy:** ⚠️ These are dangerous mobs for low levels! Take plenty of fly wings to instantly teleport in case your mob catches up with you. Have at least one or two killers, preferably a Mage with `Fireball` 🔥 or a Ninja with their AoE spells.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * 💎 **Side Winder Card:** Enables Double Attack Lvl 1. If you already have the skill, it enhances the card effect!
>     * 💎 **Valuable materials** like Rough Oridecon (for refining), White Herb (for brewing potions), and Shining Scale (sells for good zeny to NPCs).

> ### 🌊 **Byalan Dungeon (Izlude Dungeon)** 🌊
> *An excellent place to make money and level, especially with Wind-property attacks!*

> * **Monsters:**
>     * **Floor 2:** Vadon, Kukre, Hydra
>     * **Floor 3:** Obeaune, Swordfish
>     * **Floor 4:** Marc, Phen
> * **Strategy:** Nearly everything here is Water property. Use ⚡ **Wind** weapons or arrows for a massive damage boost! Most melee classes can farm here for valuable cards and sellable loot.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰

>     * 💎 **Marc Card:** Makes your armor immune to the Frozen status. Another PvP/WoE staple!
>     * 💎 **Phen Card:** Prevents your spell casting from being interrupted (but increases cast time by 25%). A must-have for any serious caster.

> ### ⭐ **Other Notable Spots** ⭐
> * **Christmas Dungeon:** The Cookies can drop some good NPC cash already, but the peak is in level 2: Kill the Myst Case for their Card, their other drops sell good to NPCs. (Access: Talk to Santa in top-right Alde Baran, then walk to town and take the Portal in the North)
> * **Metallings (Lighthalzen Field 01):** Good for melee classes with enough Flee. They drop valuable loot but can strip your weapon, so be careful!
> * **Orc Dungeon:** Awesome for Grand Cross Crusaders. Get a huge group (=mob) and kill for fast killing.
> * **Moscovia Dungeon 01:** You need to do the 'Finding the Moving Island' Quest, but it is worth it: Kill Les and Wood Goblins with 🔥 Fire for good chunks of Experience. You can advance to the other maps later.

## 🔥 Late Game Legends (Approx. Lv. 70-99) 🔥

This is where teamwork really shines. ✨ Finding a party is the fastest way to the top!
If you are solo, check for places where your build is most effective. ✨

🤫Bonus Tip: You can 'skip' a lot of levels at this stage by doing EXP Quests. The easiest way to get your build for endgame maps going! 💪

> * **Monsters:** Stalactic Golem, Anolian, Seal, Sea Otter, Medusa
> * **Strategy:**
>     * **Stalactic Golems:** Standard static party place: A wizard freezes them with 'Storm Gust', ranged AoE like 'Blitz Beat' and 'Thunderstorm' break the ice. A priest buffs everyone while the rest lures them to the killers.

>     * **Brooch[1]:** Agi *and* a slot? Amazing! But remember: The slotted version can only be equipped at level 90+.
>     *💎 **Elunium:** Stalactic Golems drop this valuable material to refine Armor.

> *A dangerous place if not prepared. You might want to team up with a static party for Level 2.*

> * **Monsters:** Kaho etc. (Level 1), Earth/Sky Deleter, Nightmare Terror etc. (Level 2)
> * **Strategy:**
>     * **Level 2:** Standard static party place: A wizard freezes them with 'Storm Gust', ranged AoE like 'Blitz Beat' and 'Thunderstorm' break the ice. A priest buffs everyone while the rest lures them to the killers. Be careful here and don't hesitate to ask other for advice.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * **Kaho Card:** 20% more Damage on Earth Property Monsters. A huge boost.

> * **Monsters (Nifflheim):** Gibbet, Dullahan, Disguise, Quve *or* Loli Ruri, Bloody Murderer

> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * 💍 **Isilla Card:** INT +2, and a chance for -50% variable cast time for 5 seconds when hit. A godsend for casters! 🤩
>     * 💍 **Vanberk Card:** STR +2, and a chance for +100 CRIT for 5 seconds when attacking. Amazing not only for critical-based builds!
>     * ⭐ **Fabric:** Drops from Dullahans and Disguises in Niffleheim and is needed for bomb brewing.

>     * 👑 **Trans-Class Gear:** Olean's Gown[1], Tidal Shoes [1] and Wool Scarf [1] are valuable gears that can drop here.


> ### 🌋 **Thor Volcano 3** 🌋
> *One of the hardest challenges for the highest-level players.*

> * **Monsters:** Kasa, Salamander, Sword & Bow Guardians
> * **Strategy:** This place is no joke! 🥵 Requires specific gear (like a **Pasana Card**) and a coordinated party with a Bragi Bard, Priest, Trapper, and Wizard (and mobbers). Ask more experienced players what to do here.
> * **Valuable Drops:** 💰
>     * 🔥 **Salamander Card:** Inflict 40% more damage with Fire Pillar and Meteor Storm.
>     * **Lesser Elemental  Ring:** All Stats +1, though not slotted.
>     * **Ring[1]:** Remember: This slotted version is only equippable at level 90+!

> ### ⭐ **Other Notable Spots** ⭐
> * **Hill Winds:** They hit hard and fast, but you can reach their Flee requirement. Can be 1-shotted with some builds. Awesome raw Zeny income here.
> * **Moscovia Dungeon 02 and 03:** Kill the Baba-Yaga in 02 for a Release of Wish. A huge upgrade for Casters. Rogues can earn serious cash on Mavkas in 03.
> * **High Orcs:** Choose between Geffen Field 14 or Alde Dungeon ('Clock Tower'). Built and equipped 'Bowling Bash' Knights can 1-shot them. Orc Archers can drop their bow, which is likely the most-wanted Bow in the game.
> * **Bathories:** Their card is very valuable. Even if you can Flee them, their spells are no joke. Come prepared with gear, potions and a *Key of Underground* to access the area.
> * **Sleepers:** Geared Monks with High STR and Occult Impaction can make a fortune here. Choose between Yuno Field 06 or 11
> * **Goats:** Vulnerable to ❄️ Cold. They are popular with Casters. Their Herbs and Bottles are valuable materials to sell.
> * **Glast Heim Chivalry:** Unless you are very confident, team up here. Use 😇 *Holy* Element to kill those Raydrics and Khalitzburgs or even the Abysmal Knights for their insanely good Card drops.
> * **Abyss Lake:** Team up here to get some juicy Cards from those Dragons. You might want to prepare different Elements to counter the enemies.

Happy leveling, and may your drops be valuable! ✨
